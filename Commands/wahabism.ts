Their **intention** was to **alienate people** from his call and obstruct it. However, the call was **not affected** in the least. On the contrary, it **spread further** in the world, and **attracted more the interest of people whom Allah has guided to seek to learn more about the nature of this call and its purposes, and the evidences from the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah it relies on.**\n \n So, people became more attached to it and began calling other people to it, all praise and thanks to Allah.**May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions** \n\n https://www.alifta.gov.sa/En/IftaContents/PermanentCommitee/Pages/default.aspx?cultStr=en&View=Page&PageID=608&PageNo=1&BookID=7 `
